# Planetary Pixels 076

Introduction -
Hi, I am Nazish Jehangir! I undertook a testing project on the BBC website, focusing on its functionality and usability, following the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) process. I identified test objectives, created the mindmap, documented test plans and scenarios, designed test cases, executed functional and usability tests, and ultimately logged defects to evaluate the site's overall performance, functionality usability, and user experience. This project aimed to ensure that the BBC website meets user expectations and performs as expected under different scenarios.

Jump into the issues section click on "CLOSED" and then click on "Planetary pixels 076" and you'll be walking through my project step by step.

Thanks :)
