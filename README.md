## Introduction -
Hi, I am Nazish Jehangir! I undertook a testing project on the BBC website, focusing on its functionality and usability, following the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) process. This project aims to ensure the BBC website meets user expectations and performs well under different scenarios. I identified test objectives, created the mindmap, documented test plans and scenarios, designed test cases, test execution reports, and defect reports.

Throw the sight above and you'll be walking through my project step by step.

Thanks :)
